# WebGIS Application Development Todo List

## Requirements Gathering
- [x] Clarify data format requirements (GDB, SHP, Feature Classes)
- [x] Determine editing capabilities needed (geometry editing, adding fields, creating features)
- [x] Confirm authentication requirements (Google authentication)
- [x] Establish UI/UX requirements (minimal for easy use)
- [x] Verify additional functionality (WMTS layer support)
